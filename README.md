## about
a macro pad and desktop control panel

Due to the permanent working from home situation I needed to switch my peripherals way more often between my work notebook and my personal computer. This resulted in having ugly HDMI- and USB-switches residing on my desk. Additionally I had to move my computer to a location where I had to stand up to start or reset my computer. That's the reason why I wanted to build a control panel with some additional macro keys and volume controls.

Fun fact: after I ordered the illuminated buttons I discovered the same ones in the Mandalorians Razor Crest.
